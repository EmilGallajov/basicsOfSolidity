# Basics of Solidity

Welcome to the **Basics of Solidity** repository! This project serves as a foundational guide for understanding and implementing smart contracts using the Solidity programming language.

## Overview

Solidity is a statically-typed, contract-oriented programming language designed for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It draws inspiration from languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, and is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
